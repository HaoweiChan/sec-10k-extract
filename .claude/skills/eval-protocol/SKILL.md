# Eval protocol

## Suites

- `invariant` — properties that must ALWAYS hold. Run automatically by the
  PostToolUse hook after every src/ edit. Must stay fast (< ~10s total).
- `fast` — the pre-commit gate suite. Golden + adversarial cases cheap enough
  to run on every commit (< ~60s total). No paid API calls here.
- `full` — a tag for slow/expensive cases (e.g. cached-LLM ones), selected via
  `--suite full`; run before a milestone, not on every commit. To run
  *everything* regardless of tags, use `--suite all`.

Tag cases via `"suites": [...]` in the case JSON; default is `["fast"]`.

## Reading a run

- Score = passed/total, printed at the end and written to `evals/report/`.
- Reports are committed to git — the report history is the progress narrative.
- A FAIL on an `adversarial` case that has never passed is expected debt;
  a FAIL on a `golden` case is a regression. The gate only compares total
  score to baseline, so eyeball WHICH cases flipped, not just the number.

## Adding a case

1. Write the JSON case first, run it, **watch it fail** (or watch it pass and
   confirm the pass is legitimate — an eval that can't go red is decoration).
2. Golden = hand-verified expected output. Record how you verified it in the
   case file under `"provenance"`.
3. Adversarial = an input that broke (or is designed to break) the pipeline.
   Every production failure and every cold-reviewer finding becomes one.

## Baseline discipline

`.eval-baseline.json` moves only via `--update-baseline`, only deliberately,
and only with an ADR (or ADR update) saying why. Downward moves are allowed
— e.g. after adding a batch of hard adversarial cases — but must be recorded.
